# 🌐 Sam Altman and Worldcoin: What You Need to Know

## Introduction
Did you know that Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT), is also behind a crypto project called Worldcoin? 🎉 Worldcoin aims to play a significant role in Altman's grand AI vision and is set to launch its own crypto token this year. But should you consider buying it? Let’s dive into the details. 🤔

## What is Worldcoin? 🤖
Worldcoin is a crypto project associated with eye-scanning orbs. Its goal is to build a global identity network where everyone can join and own a piece of it. 🌍 Specifically, Worldcoin addresses the problem of "proof of personhood"—essentially, confirming that an entity is a unique human.

### How Does It Work? 👁️
Worldcoin uses special orbs to scan your eyeball, creating a unique World ID tied to your biometrics. This ID represents your unique online identity. 🆔 The choice of eye scanning over other biometrics (like fingerprints or DNA) is due to its accuracy and scalability. Users are compensated with Worldcoin tokens for participating. 💰

- **Launch Timeline:** The Worldcoin app is already live, and they plan to launch their token in the second half of 2024. 📆

## Technological Features 💡
Worldcoin isn't just a crypto project with a token. It integrates various technologies:
- **Wallet App:** Runs on Polygon but will transition to Ethereum Layer 2. 🏦
- **Integration:** Supports ENS usernames, UniSwap, and USDC. 🔗
